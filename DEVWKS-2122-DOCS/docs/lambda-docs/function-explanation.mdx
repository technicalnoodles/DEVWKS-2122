# Functions Explanation

With Lambda functions, there is something called a handler.  This handler is the insertion point of the Lambda function.  
By default the Lambda handler will use a file called `lambda_function.py` and require a function called `lambda_handler`. If this file does not exist or does no have that function, then the function will fail to run.
