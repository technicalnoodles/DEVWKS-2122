# Passport Part 2

Mongo is the database this application uses to store data. It has events that we can create or remove and it will hold the user information we get back from WebEx.

This workshop uses a library called `Mongoose` to handle connecting and doing database operations for us. We will not need to install this library as it is already installed and being used to store events.

In the `index.js`, we can see the few lines that mention Mongoose.

```javascript title=index.js showLineNumbers
const express = require('express');
```
