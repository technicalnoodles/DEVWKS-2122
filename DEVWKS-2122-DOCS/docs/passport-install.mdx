# Passport

Passport is an authentication library that can be put into any javaScript applicaiton using `Express`.  The Passport webpage is [here](https://www.passportjs.org/).

If you look at the Passport webpage, you will notice they mention they use `Strategies`.  A strategy is their way of saying a process for authenticating to a service has been coded and made into a module for ease of use.

We will be using the `Cisco - Spark` [strategy](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-cisco-spark/) in our application.  But you can use any of the other ones they have too.  Some examples are Facebook, Google, Github, LinkedIn, and the list can go on.  But they will all work in the same way the Cisco strategy does.

To add Passport and the Cisco Spark strategy to our project, we first need to be in the `DEVWKS-2122` directory in the CLI.  Once here, run the following command:  
`npm install passport passport-cisco-spark`
